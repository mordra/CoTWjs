# Castle of the Winds js

Castle of the Winds is a tile-based RPG made by Rick Saada in the late 80s. Many old school RPGers remember the game
with fond memories and as such, this is a attempt to port the game into the modern era to be playable on mobile and web
browsers.

You can check out the current state of the game at:
